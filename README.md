# Web Development Quix


## Description
This is a multiple-choice quiz with a countdown timer. It gives the user directions and a button to start the quiz. When this is clicked, the quiz starts, and 60 second countdown timer is displayed in the top left. When the quiz gets to 0 seconds or when the user answers all 3 questions (whichever comes first), it displays their score (seconds remaining). The user is then able to enter their initials and their score into a highscores list.
